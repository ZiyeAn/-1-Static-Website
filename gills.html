                Differences in gills
            </h2>
            <p>Mushroom Gills (Lamellae) are the thin, blade-like structures located on the underside of the mushroom cap. They are a key feature in many mushrooms, especially gilled fungi (Agaricales), and play an important role in spore production. The gills release spores into the air, which allows the mushroom to reproduce.</p>
            <h2>Types of Mushrooms Based on Gills</h2>
            <p>	•	Gilled Mushrooms (Agaricales): The most common type of mushrooms, including species like Agaricus bisporus (button mushrooms) and Amanita muscaria.<br>
                •	Non-Gilled Mushrooms: Some species, like boletes and chanterelles, have pores or ridges instead of gills, but are often confused with gilled mushrooms because of their overall cap-and-stem structure.</p>
            <h2>Importance of Gills in Mushroom Identification</h2>
            <p>The attachment, color, and spacing of gills are often essential clues in distinguishing between species that may otherwise look similar. For example, closely related mushrooms may have similar caps and stems but different gill attachments or spore colors.<br>
            Different groups of mushrooms are classified based on whether they have gills or other spore-bearing structures. For instance:Agarics: True gilled mushrooms (e.g., Agaricus, Amanita). Boletes: Instead of gills, they have pores or tubes (e.g., Boletus). Chanterelles: Have ridges rather than true gills.
