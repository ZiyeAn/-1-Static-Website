                What is Spore Print?
            </h2>
            <p>	Spores are the reproductive cells of mushrooms, equivalent to seeds in plants. They are produced on the gills, pores, or other spore-bearing surfaces and are released into the environment to help the mushroom reproduce.<br>
            A spore print is made by placing the cap of a mature mushroom gill-side down on a surface. As the mushroom releases its spores, they fall onto the surface, forming a print that reveals the spore color.<br>
            Spore prints come in a range of colors, and identifying the exact color can help narrow down the mushroomâ€™s genus or species. Common spore print colors include white, Brown, Black, Pink, Yellow,Purple-Brown.</p>

            <h2>
                How to Make a Spore Print?
            </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pick a Mature Mushroom: Choose a fully opened cap, as immature mushrooms may not release enough spores.</li>
                <li>Remove the Stem: Cut off the stem so the cap can lie flat.</li>
                <li>Place the Cap: Put the cap gill-side down on a piece of paper. Use both white and black paper to accommodate spores of different colors (some mushrooms produce white spores, which would be invisible on white paper, and dark spores on black paper).</li>
                <li>Cover the Cap: Place a bowl or glass over the cap to prevent air drafts from dispersing the spores.</li>
                <li>Wait for the Spores to Drop: Leave the mushroom for several hours or overnight. As the spores fall, they form a print on the paper.</li>
                <li>Observe the Print: Once the print is formed, observe the spore color. This is one of the key identifying characteristics of mushrooms.</li>
